```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)

class2018 <- read_excel("class_enrollment_summary_by_term_10.10.18.xlsx", skip = 3)
class2017 <- read_excel("class_enrollment_summary_by_term_10.20.17.xlsx", skip = 3)

```


```{r cars}

class2018 %>% 
  select("Course ID", "Course Title", "Course Name", "Total") %>% 
  arrange(desc(Total))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
